The Alif Laila Introductory Astronomy project was started to bring astronomy education to children and students of all ages through the Alif Laila book bus society. Along with lesson plans, practice problems, and videos, the project allows learners to access a remote observatory housed in Texas that can be used to observe the night sky.
